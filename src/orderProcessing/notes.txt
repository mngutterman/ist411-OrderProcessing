I realized I don't actually have your contact info.  Anyway, I'm not feeling great today so I won't be around, but I'll keep working on the order processing stuff. Hopefully you see this file...


Word, my number is 202 352 0365, text me if you have any questions about some of the code I wrote.

The full project is due Thursday. I've finished most of it, but can you test the code / fill in things
if I've missed anything?
