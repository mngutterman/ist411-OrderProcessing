I realized I don't actually have your contact info.  Anyway, I'm not feeling great today so I won't be around, but I'll keep working on the order processing stuff. Hopefully you see this file...


Word, my number is 202 352 0365, text me if you have any questions about some of the code I wrote.
The most not straightforward thing I did was made inventory a singleton class. If you're not sure what that
is I can explain it to you
