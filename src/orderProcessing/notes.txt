I realized I don't actually have your contact info.  Anyway, I'm not feeling great today so I won't be around, but I'll keep working on the order processing stuff. Hopefully you see this file...


Word, my number is 202 352 0365, text me if you have any questions about some of the code I wrote.
The most not straightforward thing I did was made inventory a singleton class. If you're not sure what that
is I can explain it to you.


Yo this whole thing is actually due on thursday so we should probably get moving.
    - most places that I just System.out.printLn, we need to prompt the user and stuff.
    - I didn't spent a ton of time debugging, just the basics. check it out if you can.
